## Principles

<br/>

- community developed, and community owned
- transparent, open
- intuitive & expressive

<!--
  - transparent, open (distribute and modify—user contributer)
  - aligned incentives (vs commercial, e.g.)
  - paves way towards reproducible research
-->

<!--
- importance of language and library choices
-->

<!--
- general-purpose
  - prioritizes human (not computer) time
-->

Notes:

- This is the best way to align incentives for doing good quality, transparent, reproducible science
- We believe that researchers know their needs best
- Their ideas must be surfaced and integrated into the computational
  platform as efficiently as possible
- In this endeavor, making money for shareholders is at best a
  distraction
  - But often, it incentivises entirely the wrong things: hardware
    locks, license servers, closed file formats
  - Incentive to lock users into  proprietary systems
    - This prohibits sharing, reproducibility, and transparency

- Transparency: you *should* always be able to investigate the
  *entire* scientific stack.
- To know answers are accurate, you have to be able to look under the
  hood.
- You also need to be able to modify tools to do *new things*, to do
  *whatever* needs to be done.
- The change required is bigger than just open software; you need
  reproducible research as well (i.e. data/methods publishing). But
  it's a start.

- The **importance of language and library choices** cannot be underestimated.

- General-purpose
- Readable code
- Prioritize human (not computer) time

- Re-emphasises the notion of a user-developer
- Library interfaces and language clarity / expressivity matter: it's
  how we express our thoughts.

## Practices

<img src="images/practice.png"/>

http://www.jarrodmillman.com/publications/millman2014developing.pdf

<!--
<br/>

**Technical**

- Revision control
- Testing / continuous integration
- Code review
- Documentation
- Iteration

**Social**

- Governance and Coordination

Notes:

No matter how sound philosophy, we still need working code!

Code review both during development cycle, but also during use where
users can easily introspect for problems. -->

<!-- Documentation has to stay in sync with code (docstrings). -->

## People

<img src="images/community.png"/>

<br/>


Notes:

- Work done in collaboration is better and more fun.

  - **Community** is meaningful.
  - **Culture** is important for good work.
  - **Leadership** sets direction.
  - **Governance** sets expectations and reduces misunderstandings.

- Community

  - Many of my best friends I made through this ecosystem.

  - These have been the most fulfilling and educational collaborations
    of my life.

  - Being part of a movement where everyone is aligned is incredibly
    exciting.

  - For me, personally, it's been transformative to my career. Lots of
    people have helped me get where I am today.

- Culture

  - In a volunteer effort you cannot afford *not* to treat people
    well

  - Unsurprisingly, when people feel welcome, listened to, engaged, they produce
    better work

- Leadership

  - It helps greatly when the founders of projects set the right tone;
    one of the things that drew me into SP from the beginning

    - Various projects had you earn your badge
    - SP phone call from Berkeley: trust placed in newcomers,
      welcomed with open arms, treated with respect (listen to opinions)
