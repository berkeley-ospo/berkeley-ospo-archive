## People

Notes:

- Work done in collaboration is better and more fun.

  - **Community** is meaningful.
  - **Culture** is important for good work.
  - **Leadership** sets direction.
  - **Governance** sets expectations and reduces misunderstandings.

- Community

  - Many of my best friends I made through this ecosystem.

  - These have been the most fulfilling and educational collaborations
    of my life.

  - Being part of a movement where everyone is aligned is incredibly
    exciting.

  - For me, personally, it's been transformative to my career. Lots of
    people have helped me get where I am today.

- Culture

  - In a volunteer effort you cannot afford *not* to treat people
    well

  - Unsurprisingly, when people feel welcome, listened to, engaged, they produce
    better work

- Leadership

  - It helps greatly when the founders of projects set the right tone;
    one of the things that drew me into SP from the beginning

    - Various projects had you earn your badge
    - SP phone call from Berkeley: trust placed in newcomers,
      welcomed with open arms, treated with respect (listen to opinions)
